blogpost modifications 
======================

blogpost.py was modified to fix the following:
1. Disabled santize_html function. Perhaps this was necessary for some previous version of wordpress (currently 3.9) but is no longer needed. Removes new lines in <pre></pre> blocks.
2. Added tidy_html function to format HTML using the std tidy command
3. Modified default wordpress.conf to mostly use the asciidoc xhtml11
4. Modified to store .blogpost files in hidden .blogpost dir
