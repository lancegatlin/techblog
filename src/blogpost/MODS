blogpost modifications 
======================

blogpost.py was modified to fix the following:
1. Disabled santize_html function. Perhaps this was necessary for some previous version of wordpress (currently 3.9) but is no longer needed. Removes new lines in <pre></pre> blocks.
2. Added tidy_html function to format HTML using the std tidy command
3. Modified default wordpress.conf to mostly use the asciidoc xhtml11
4. Modified to store .blogpost files in hidden .blogpost dir
5. Modified to store blogpost conf and tidy conf file in .blogpost directory
6. Modified tidy_html to tell tidy to use tidy.conf to allow tidy to correctly recognize html but perform a least-destructive indent on the asciidoc html-snippet output
7. Modified shell to allow setting expected return code instead of 0 to deal with tidy working but returning 1
